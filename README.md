# Learning C... the hard way. 
I'm teaching myself C using Zed Shaw's "Learn C The Hard Way" (Is there an easy way?). This repo has all of the code I write based on exercises in the book.

EDIT: I've abandoned this in order to do some web development, and also because I'll be learding C at uni soon anyway. I might come back and finish this someitme.
